## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of a methodology for automated segmentation of brain structures in cranial tomography exams.
The main objective is to speed up the annotation process and minimize manual intervention through the use of segmentation techniques based on deep neural networks.
This approach is based on [4], Kim, K., Kanezaki, A., & Tanaka, Y. (2020).

## Methodology

The methodology adopted in this work consists of an approach that employs automated brain region segmentation techniques. The validation flow of the proposed methodology is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig: flowchart_methodology}.

In the data pre-processing stage (Section \ref{Pre_Processing}), tomography exams are standardized and subjected to interpolation and windowing procedures to eliminate irrelevant information.

The architecture of the proposed segmenter is detailed in Section \ref{sec:segmentor}, where the procedures for feature extraction, data permutation, calculation of evaluation metrics, among others, are presented.

The optimization of the model's hyperparameters is discussed in Section \ref{optimizando_hiper}, where issues such as optimizer selection, number of convolutional filters, number of convolutional layers, among others, are addressed.

Finally, the evaluation of the proposed model is described in Section \ref{secao_avaliacao}, where the comparison metrics with other methodologies established in the literature and the qualitative evaluation by medical radiologists are presented.
